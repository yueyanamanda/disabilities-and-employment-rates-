# üìä NHIS 2023: Disability and Employment Analysis Using SAS

This project uses SAS 9.4 to analyze the 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset, focusing on the relationship between sensory disabilities (vision and hearing) and employment status among U.S. adults aged 18‚Äì64. The analysis supports policy evaluation and public health recommendations aimed at improving workforce equity for individuals with disabilities.

## üß† Project Goals

- Identify how vision and hearing disabilities affect employment status
- Control for demographic and socioeconomic covariates
- Generate weighted national estimates using complex survey design
- Provide reproducible SAS code for public health research

## üõ† Methods & Techniques

- Data import and transformation (`PROC IMPORT`, `DATA`, `IF`, `FORMAT`)
- Descriptive statistics (`PROC MEANS`, `PROC FREQ`)
- Weighted estimates using complex survey design:
  - `PROC SURVEYFREQ`
  - `PROC SURVEYMEANS`
  - `PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC`
- Bivariate and multivariate analysis
- Adjusted odds ratios for disability-employment associations

## üìà Key Findings

- Adults with **vision or hearing disabilities** were significantly less likely to be employed.
- After adjustment, individuals with **severe vision impairment** had **reduced odds of employment** compared to those with no impairment.
- The project highlights the need for accessible employment opportunities and targeted workforce support services.
